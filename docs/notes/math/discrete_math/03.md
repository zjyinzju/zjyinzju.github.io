# Algorithms (算法)

## Algorithm 
+ Def: A **finite** set of **precise** instructions for performing a computation or for solving a problem.(有限的、精确的指令集合，用于执行计算或解决问题)
+ Properties:
    - **Input**: Zero or more inputs.
    - **Output**: At least one output.
    - **Correctness**: The algorithm must produce the correct output for each input.
    - **Finiteness**: The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
    - **Effectiveness**: Each instruction must be basic enough to be carried out exactly and in a finite amount of time.
    - **Generality**: The algorithm must be applicable to a range of problems.
